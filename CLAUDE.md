## Skill Routing
When user request matches a skill, invoke it via the Skill tool.

- Product/strategy → `/office-hours` → `/autoplan`
- Code review → `/review`
- QA/testing → `/qa`
- Design → `/design-review` or `/design-html`
- Marketing copy → `/copywriting`
- Conversion → `/cro`
- Security → `/cso`
- Deploy/ship → `/ship`

## Session Rules
1. Always load master-hub + one project repo
2. Never mix clients
3. Use GBrain (`/learn`) to save insights across sessions

## Deliverables SOP
1. Deploy = manual zip drag-and-drop to Netlify. Never automate deploys via API/MCP.
2. **Always deliver BOTH: (a) the file as a clickable chat attachment (SendUserFile), and (b) its full folder path written as a clickable file reference in the message** — the attachment is for drag-and-drop, the path lets the user open the location (e.g. to rename the file). A file left only in the folder, or a path never written out, is an incomplete delivery.
3. Zip the contents of `dist/` (with `_redirects`), name it `<project>-<version>-site.zip`.
