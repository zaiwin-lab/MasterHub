# Master Hub — Claude Code Global Context

## Core Identity
This is the master hub. Load this alongside every project session.

## Skills Available

These skills live in `.claude/skills/` and load automatically every session — no install needed.

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/impeccable` | Frontend design: craft, audit, critique, polish, animate, etc. (23 commands) |

### gstack install (not committed — ~1.6 GB)
gstack is too large to commit. Install it into the session with one command:
```bash
bash .claude/scripts/install-gstack.sh

## Skill Routing
When user request matches a skill, invoke it via the Skill tool.

- Product/strategy → `/office-hours` → `/autoplan`
- Code review → `/review`
- QA/testing → `/qa`
- Design → `/design-review` or `/design-html`
- Marketing copy → `/copywriting`
- Conversion → `/cro`
- Security → `/cso`
- Deploy/ship → `/ship`

## Session Rules
1. Always load master-hub + one project repo
2. Never mix clients
3. Use GBrain (`/learn`) to save insights across sessions
