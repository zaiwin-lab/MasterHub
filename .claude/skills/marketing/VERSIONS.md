## Recent Changes

### 2.3.0 (2026-05-27)

- Added `marketing-plan` skill — comprehensive AARRR-structured marketing plan generator. Produces a 13-section Notion-paste-ready plan document (executive summary, strategic frame, current state, AARRR breakdown, 90-day roadmap, 12-month outlook with funding-stage capability unlocks, marketing operations stack mapping skills + MCPs to AARRR stages, tactical idea bank cross-referencing all 139 `marketing-ideas` to AARRR + client-specific status, measurement framework, RACI, open decisions). Customized for current budget, team, stage, and tooling stack. Three-phase workflow: INIT (research + intake), REVIEW (section-by-section walkthrough), FINALIZE (compile + verify + optional publish to shared repo). References include methodology, plan-template, aarrr-framework, current-state-rubric (self-contained 17-section scoring rubric), ops-stack-mapping, idea-cross-reference (139-idea AARRR mapping), funding-stage-unlocks, measurement-framework, client-types (variations by B2B SaaS / D2C / hardware-hybrid / marketplace / dev tool / clinical / commerce), example-quietude (anonymized canonical reference plan, based on a real fCMO engagement with names/identifying details changed), budget-planning (two scientific methods for setting the marketing budget — Revenue-Based 5–40% of ARR, and Goal-Based formula reverse-engineered from the revenue target; plus blended CAC calculation, the 10–20% experimental buffer rule, the 3-3-2-2-2 VC growth path, and the forecasting reality check), growth-patterns (the real shape of SaaS growth — $0–10K / $10K–100K / $100K–1M phases with binding constraints, linear vs step-function vs S-curve patterns, and Channel × Product × Market layering), and team-and-agency-model (the strategy-in-house / execution-outsourced principle, three core functions Growth/Product/Content, π-shaped marketer framework, title progression Manager → Lead → Director → VP → Chief, agency selection framework, and the three-stage scaling model Early/Growth/Scale). Budget, growth-pattern, and team frameworks drawn from *Founding Marketing* by Corey Haines.
- Total skills: 43.

### 2.2.0 (2026-05-26)

- Added `prospecting` skill for building qualified prospect lists across SaaS, B2B, and local SMB motions. Includes shared 5-phase framework (ICP → discovery → qualify → score → output) plus branch-specific references (saas-prospecting, b2b-prospecting, local-prospecting), data-sources guide covering Apollo / Clay / ZoomInfo / Clearbit / Hunter / Snov / Truelist / RB2B / Sales Nav / BuiltWith / Crunchbase / GitHub, and compliance reference (CAN-SPAM, GDPR, CASL, platform ToS).
- Added `tools/clis/github-prospects.js` CLI for pulling GitHub stargazers, forkers, and watchers as a developer-intent signal — with pagination, enrichment, filter-based early termination, and CSV output.
- Added new tool integration docs: `truelist` (email deliverability validation, OpenAPI-aligned), `github` (REST API for prospecting), `firecrawl` (single-target page scraping), `browserbase` (real Chromium for JS-heavy pages or interaction).
- **ads** (2.0.0 → 2.0.1): added Google RSA Output Spec section enforcing 15 headlines × 30 chars, 4 descriptions × 90 chars, ad group structure labels, ≥8 negative keywords, ≥4 sitelinks/callouts, output ordering to avoid truncation, and a self-check before responding. Includes optional Brazilian medical (CFM) compliance rules when product context indicates that vertical.
- Added `sequenzy` tool integration (email marketing platform with MCP support).
- Fixed plugin.json version drift (was stuck at 1.9.0 across three releases) — `sync-skills.js` now auto-syncs `plugin.json` version to `marketplace.json` on every change. Closes #323.
- Added skill install artifacts (`.agents/`, `.claude/`, `skills-lock.json`) to `.gitignore`.
- Total skills: 42.

### 2.1.0 (2026-05-21)
- Added `sms` skill for SMS/MMS marketing — welcome flows, abandoned cart, post-purchase, win-back, promotional sends, and transactional/auth. Includes compliance reference (TCPA, A2P 10DLC, GDPR, CASL), sequence templates with character counts, and platform comparison (Klaviyo, Postscript, Attentive, Twilio, Brevo, SimpleTexting, Customer.io).
- Total skills: 41

### 2.0.1 (2026-05-18)

Content patch — no breaking changes, no new skills.

- **ai-seo** (2.0.0 → 2.0.1): aligned with Google's official AI features optimization guide. Added sections for Google's stance on AI optimization, query fan-out, agentic experiences (including UCP), explicit "what NOT to do" (scaled content abuse, etc.), and Search Console expectations. Reframed llms.txt / pricing.md / schema markup recommendations as "Google says not required, helpful for non-Google AI engines." Moved content-type tactics to `references/content-types.md` (added local/ecom Merchant Center + Business Profile guidance per Google).
- **image** (2.0.0 → 2.0.1): refreshed model lineup to current May 2026 releases — Nano Banana / Nano Banana Pro family naming, Flux Pro 1.1 + Kontext + Dev + Schnell variants, Ideogram 3.0, ChatGPT Images 2.0 / GPT Image, Midjourney v7, Recraft V3, SD 3.5 / SDXL. Updated decision tree and trigger phrases.
- **video** (2.0.0 → 2.0.1): refreshed model lineup — Sora 2 promoted from limited-availability caveat, Kling 2.5/3.0, added Seedance (ByteDance), Hailuo / MiniMax (character consistency), Hunyuan Video / Wan 2 (open-weight self-hosted), Pika 2.x. New "Quick picks" guide.
